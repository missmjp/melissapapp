        <p> <strong>About Me</strong> </p>
          <p> I am extremely curious about the world around me. I love to figure out how things work and nothing is off limits.
          When I served in the U.S. Coast Guard, I was able to use technology to navigate the seas and experience the freedom of sailing the worldâ€™s oceans. </p>

          <p> Using math and science to as a tool to experience life and discover new things is extremely empowering skill for anyone and can be taught to all people from all backgrounds.
          As an educator, I love to motivate all people and help them accomplish their goals.  As a web developer, I aim to design a fun user experience and content
         that enables you to learn and express yourself. </p>
